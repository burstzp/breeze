# Simple HTTP Server Inspired by Tornado

This is a simple HTTP server inspired by [Tornado Web Server](https://github.com/facebook/tornado),
for practising my Linux programming kills. No third-party libraries are used, only glibc.

This project is still a work-on-progress. It is not working now, but feel free to read any code you
are interested in.
